/**
 * Serialized fit-recompute queue. The IPC handler `recomputeFit` is
 * single-shot per call, but the user can click "Recompute Fit" on
 * multiple jobs (or click the same one twice) before the first one
 * resolves. Running them in parallel would compete for the LLM
 * provider's rate limit and produce interleaved `job:scoreUpdated`
 * events. Instead, we serialize: one in-flight call, the rest wait
 * in a FIFO queue with a hard cap of 10.
 *
 * Each enqueue is associated with a callback (typically "update my
 * local state with the result") — the callback runs whether the call
 * resolved or threw, so the calling component can show the result
 * (or the error toast) without waiting on a separate channel.
 *
 * The queue fires `app:fit-progress` events with delta ±1 per
 * in-flight call so the sidebar's "Calculating Fit…" indicator
 * stays accurate when a click is queued (counts as pending) vs.
 * when it's actively running. Stale-tab close is safe: a queued
 * jobId that the user no longer cares about still runs to
 * completion and the matching decrement still fires.
